imgyazur
========

imgyazur is a clone of gyazo that uploads the image to imgur.com rather than the ugly, ad-infested gyazo website.
It sits in your system tray until you activate it, and then allows you to capture and upload a portion (or all) of your screen with a single click.

Usage
-----

1. Install the program using the .msi (build your own, or ask me for a link).
2. Start the program. It will sit in your system tray lookin' awesome.
3. Start the capture process by doing one of two things:
    * Click the icon in your system tray.
    * Mash the keyboard shortcut (ctrl+alt+shift D by default)
4. Once the cross cursor appears, click and drag across the area of the screen you want to capture.
5. Wait for the upload. Hover over the tray icon to see progress.
6. Cry tears of joy as your image appears in your browser, ready for copying.

Right click on the tray icon to configure boot options, change the hotkey, or exit the program.

Compiling

If you don't have an apikey.cs with a 'public static string key =', **you're gonna have a bad time**.
