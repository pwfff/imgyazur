imgyazur
========

imgyazur is a clone of gyazo that uploads the image to imgur.com rather than the ugly, ad-infested gyazo website.

Usage
-----

1. Run the program. A cross cursor will appear.
2. Left click and drag the cursor across the area of the screen you wish to capture. Pressing any other mouse button or key at this point will exit the program without doing anything.
3. The selected area will upload to imgur.com, and the resulting .png will open in your default browser.

Compiling
---------

If you don't have an apikey.cs with a 'public static string key =', **you're gonna have a bad time**.
